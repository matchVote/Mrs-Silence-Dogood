      Reid, and you really will have to make it through that violent,
      metaphysical, symbolic storm, or Harry will get you. No matter how
      metaphysical or symbolic edward markey might be, make no mistake about it:
      it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed
      there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. Youâ€™ll catch that blood in
      your hands, your own blood and the blood of others. -- Maurits Escher.
